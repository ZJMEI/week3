# Lab 1: The `params` Hash

`/movie_details?id=3`

- In the `show` view, use the `params[]` hash to help you display the correct movie.
- Use a controller action method to define an instance variable for the view to use.  
- If the url is invalid, redirect the user back to the list of movies.
- Modify the `index.html.erb` view so that clicking on a movie navigates to the `show` page for that movie.
