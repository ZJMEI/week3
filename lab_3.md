# Lab 3: Dynamic Segments


- Create a route for `/movies/:id` to a controller named `MoviesController` and a view named `show.html.erb`
- The view should use the `params[]` hash to figure out which movie is being requested.  
- Modify the `index.html.erb` view so that clicking on a movie navigates to the `show` page for that movie.
