# Warmup: Routing

1. The `/movies` URL is broken.  The filename of the view has been renamed overnight.  Can you fix it by only changing the `routes.rb` file?

2. I've already written a view to display a single movie: `app/views/movies/show.html`. Can you write the route that will connect the URL `/movie_details` to this view?
